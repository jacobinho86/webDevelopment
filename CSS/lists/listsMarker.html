		<p>16 bit consoles example:</p>
        <ul class="console16">
            <li>Turbo Graphics-16: This one was never marketed in Mexico, at least in Guadalajara. It uses cards for games.</li>
            <li>Sega Genesis: The last great console from Sega, maybe it had a longer lifespan that it should had had.</li>
            <li>Super Nintendo: The BEST console of all time in my humble (or not so humble) opinion.</li>
        </ul>
		<p>32 bit consoles example:</p>
        <ul class="console32">
            <li>Sega Saturn: this is the one i've never even seen, but now it has a lot of my interest.</li>
            <li>Playstation: the winner by far of that generation, the first console from Sony.</li>
            <li>Nintendo 64: The only console of the generation that still used cartiges, very good for party games.</li>
        </ul>
